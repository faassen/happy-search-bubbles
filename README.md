# Happy Search Bubbles

NOTE: this is very much a work in progress, and this text below is describes goals, not the current implementation.

What is Happy Search Bubbles? It's a way to have fulltext search over a section
of the web and topic you are interested in. For each topic, you select the web
sites you want to search yourself: you create a bubble. Once you have a bubble,
you can search it, browse through it, and other things.

Creating your own bubbles sounds lonely and a chore, but these are happy
bubbles. You can share your bubbles with others. You can also expand other
people's bubbles.

This puts people in charge of creating and curating search bubbles. With active
curation, SEO, advertising and slop can be excluded from the search experience.
It's not the same as a full web search, but your search experience within a
bubble should be more human and happier.

## How to create a bubble

We provide software for you to manage your bubbles and publish them. But in
reality, happy search bubbles are just HTML web pages full of links, following
a few simple rules. You can publish them in any way you publish HTML.

## How to search a bubble?

You need to have a search engine! Oh no, how do I install a search engine?
Don't worry, we provide one. You can provide it with bubble pages and it will
index them and let you search them. 

You can also provide rules for when to reindex (reindex always upon change of
bubble, reindex content incrementally).

### How do I search multiple bubbles at once?

Since you can link bubbles to other bubbles, you can create a larger bubble out
of multiple smaller ones.
