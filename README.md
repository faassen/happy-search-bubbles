# Happy Search Bubbles

NOTE: this is very much a work in progress, and this text below is ideal

What is Happy Search Bubbles? It's a way to have fulltext search over a section
of the web and topic you are interested in. For each topic, you select the web
sites you want to search yourself: you create a bubble. Once you have a bubble,
you can search it, browse through it, and other things.

Creating your own bubbles sounds lonely and a chore, but these are happy
bubbles. You can share your bubbles with others. You can also expand other
people's bubbles.

People curate their own search bubbles.

## How to create a bubble

We provide software for you to manage your bubbles and publish them. But in
reality, happy search bubbles are just HTML web pages full of links, following
a few simple rules. You can publish them in any way you publish HTML.

The rules:

The page has a special topic link to a wikipedia page that describes the topic.

The page can have links to other bubble pages it expands upon.

A section further contains a bunch of links. Links have classes, meaning "whole
site", "just this page" or "everything linked under this path", and also
"exclude" to explicitly exclude stuff possibly previously included (to exclude
something provided by this or a linked bubble).

Can have a reference included to a pre-baked index.

## How to search a bubble?

You need to have a search engine! Oh no, how do I install a search engine?
Don't worry, we provide one. You can provide it with bubble pages and it will
index them and let you search them. 

To help others search without having to index separately, you can publish your
index too!

You can also provide rules for when to reindex (reindex always upon change of
bubble, reindex content incrementally).

### How do I search multiple bubbles at once?

Since you can link bubbles to other bubbles, you can create a larger bubble out
of multiple smaller ones.
